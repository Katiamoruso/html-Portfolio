<h3>Into the wild</h3>

<p>This is the first one because I love wildness and it's really profound,</br>
      reminding us what's seriously important in life.</p>
<h3>Coyote Ugly</h3>

<p>This is my second movie on the list because it's amazing where your talent can take you,</br>
     and it teach you to never give up and follow your dreams no matter how hard things are.</p>
<h3>Wonder Woman</h3>

    and that honestly and love are always the right path tp follow.</p>
